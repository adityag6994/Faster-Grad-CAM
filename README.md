# Faster-Grad-CAM
**Faster and more precisely than Grad-CAM.**

![fig1](https://github.com/shinmura0/Faster-Grad-CAM/blob/master/images/janken.png "fig1")

Upper result is...
+ The size of images is 96 * 96.  
+ We use MobileNet V2 with ArcFace.  
+ We measure the processing time on Colaboratory(Tesla P4).

## Based paper
*Coming soon.*  

We change below.
+ change Triplet to ArcFace.  
+ change k-means clusters(from 50 to 10).

## Usage(Janken Demo)
Coming soon.

### More faster(Raspberry Pi)
+ Change MobileNet V2 to V3.Because V3 is faster than V2 on CPU.
+ Change Raspberry Pi3 to Pi4.

## Procedure of training
Coming soon.
